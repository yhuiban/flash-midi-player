    Before any sound can be produced, the synthesizer needs a
    SoundFont. For a discussion on SoundFont please refer to some
    other, not yet existing, therefore virtual document.
    </p><p>
    SoundFonts are loaded with the
    <code class="function">fluid_synth_sfload</code> function. The function
    takes the path to a SoundFont file as argument and a boolean to
    indicate whether the presets of the MIDI channels should be
    updated after the SoundFont is loaded. More on the preset updates
    below.
    </p><p>
    The synthesizer can load any number of SoundFonts. This is an
    advantage, of course, but there are some issues that you must be
    aware of. The presets in a SoundFont are identified by their bank
    and preset number. The MIDI specifications allows the change of a
    preset on a MIDI channel using the combination of "bank select"
    and the "program change" messages. An ambiguity arrizes when a
    preset with a specific bank and preset number is defined in
    multiple loaded SoundFonts. This is solved by searching the
    SoundFonts in the inverse order they were loaded, i.e. the lastly
    loaded SoundFont is searched first for the request preset
    (identified by bank and preset number) then the on but last loaded
    SoundFont, and so on until. The first preset found is then
    used. You can somehow consider the SoundFonts placed on a
    stack. The SoundFont on top of the stack is inspected first,
    followed by the SoundFont down on the stack. Newly loaded
    SoundFonts are always placed on top of the stack. This is how
    commercial, hardware synthesizers work. The inconvenience is that
    a preset in a SoundFont at the bottom end of the stack may be
    masked by a preset in a SoundFont at the top of the stack. Using
    the standard MIDI messages, bank select and program change, there
    is no way to select a masked preset. However, FluidSynth has an
    API function to unambiguously select a preset
    (<code class="function">fluid_synth_program_select</code>). This function
    is not invokeable through MIDI messages, though.  
    </p><p>
    The <code class="function">fluid_synth_sfload</code> function returns the
    unique identifier of the loaded SoundFont, or -1 in case of an
    error. This identifier is used in subsequent management functions:
    <code class="function">fluid_synth_sfunload</code> removes the SoundFont,
    <code class="function">fluid_synth_sfreload</code> reloads the
    SoundFont. When a SoundFont is reloaded, it retains it's ID and
    position on the SoundFont stack.  
    </p><p>
    Additional API functions are provided to get the number of loaded
    SoundFonts ot to get a pointer to the SoundFont.
    </p><p>
    Another issue that needs some explanation is the reprogramming of
    the presets after a SoundFont load or unload. The default behavior
    of commercial synthesizers is to reset all the preset that are
    programmed on the MIDI channels when a SoundFont is loaded or
    unloaded. Consider the case where MIDI channel 1 uses preset (0,
    0) (the couple indicates the bank and program number). This preset
    was found in the SoundFont with ID 3, for example. When a new
    SoundFont is loaded that also contains a preset with bank number 0
    and program number 0, then the newly loaded preset will be used on
    channel 1 for future events. This behavior is as if a bank select
    and program change message is send to all channels after a
    load/unload using the channel's bank and program number. This may
    be sometimes confusing or unwanted. A user may not want to loose
    its preset setup when a new SoundFont is loaded. To avoid the
    reprogramming of the presets, the third parameter to the
    <code class="function">fluid_synth_sfload</code> and
    <code class="function">fluid_synth_sfunload</code> functions should be set
    to zero.
